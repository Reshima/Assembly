# Assembly
These programs take an array of 20 integers from the user and print it out in three distinct formats.

Lab1n(Column):
This program prompts the user to type out 20 integers and then prints them out one integer per line from the stored array.

Lab1n(Single):
This program prompts the user to type out 20 integers and then prints them out on a single line with a space in between.

Lab1n(Reverse):
This program prompts the user to type out 20 integers and then prints them out in reverse order on a single line with a space in between.
It then asks the user for another integer and prints the array with n (n being the previously entered integer) numbers per line.
